# Subtopic Pages Documentation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented separate pages for each subtopic in the curriculum for all subjects. This provides students with detailed, focused learning content for each module within a course.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Routing Structure
- **New Route**: `/courses/[id]/subtopics/[subtopic]`
- **Example**: `/courses/1/subtopics/number-and-basic-algebra`

### 2. Enhanced Course Page
- **Interactive Curriculum**: Each module in the curriculum tab now links to its detailed subtopic page
- **Visual Enhancements**: Added hover effects, icons, and descriptive text
- **URL Generation**: Automatic conversion of module names to URL-friendly slugs

### 3. Comprehensive Subtopic Pages
Each subtopic page includes:
- **Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable goals
- **Key Topics**: Detailed breakdown of content areas
- **Practice Areas**: Specific skills to develop
- **Exam Tips**: Strategic advice for assessments
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge before starting
- **Difficulty Level & Duration**: Clear expectations

## Technical Implementation

### URL Slug Generation
- Automatic conversion of module names to URL-friendly formats
- Handles special characters, spaces, and punctuation
- Examples:
  - "Number and Basic Algebra" → "number-and-basic-algebra"
  - "Atomic Structure and Periodic Table" → "atomic-structure-and-periodic-table"

### TypeScript Integration
- Fully typed subtopic data structure
- Type-safe component props
- IntelliSense support for development

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Consistent styling with main course pages
- Interactive tabs for different content sections

## Navigation Features

### Breadcrumb Navigation
- Clear path from Home → Courses → Course → Subtopic
- All links functional and properly styled

### Interactive Tabs
1. **Overview**: General description and metadata
2. **Learning Objectives**: What students will achieve
3. **Key Topics**: Detailed content breakdown
4. **Practice Areas**: Skills development focus
5. **Exam Tips**: Strategic assessment guidance

### Call-to-Action Buttons
- "Start Learning" - Begin the subtopic
- "Download Resources" - Access additional materials
- "Back to Course" - Return to main course page

## Usage

### For Students
1. Navigate to any course page
2. Click on the "Curriculum" tab
3. Click on any module to access detailed subtopic content
4. Use tabs to explore different aspects of the topic

### For Developers
1. Add new subtopics to the `subtopicsData` object
2. Follow the existing TypeScript interface structure
3. URL slugs are automatically generated from module names

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Interactive Exercises**: Embedded practice problems
2. **Progress Tracking**: Student completion status
3. **Video Content**: Embedded educational videos
4. **Assessment Tools**: Quick quizzes and tests
5. **Resource Downloads**: PDF materials and worksheets
6. **Discussion Forums**: Student and tutor interaction

### Additional Subjects
